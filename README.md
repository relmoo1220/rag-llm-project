# Simple Finance RAG LLM ChatBot

A simple chatbot that enables users to query financial statements of major companies from 2009 to 2022. This Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application integrates a SvelteKit frontend, FastAPI backend, and ChromaDB as a vector database to power efficient and relevant financial queries. Using Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers, the app leverages a question-answering model to provide accurate responses based on extracted document data.

### Current Models In-Use

- **Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5**: A sentence similarity model used to generate embeddings for the financial documents. These embeddings are stored in ChromaDB, enabling the chatbot to perform efficient, contextually relevant search and retrieval of information.

- **deepset/roberta-base-squad2**: A question-answering model fine-tuned on SQuAD2.0, used to interpret user queries. It processes relevant sections retrieved from ChromaDB to generate accurate responses to finance-related questions, providing an interactive, LLM-powered Q&A experience.
